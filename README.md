# MD_post_processing

Welcome to the MD_post_processing repository! This guide provides instructions on how to run Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

## Overview
This repository focuses on the simulation process itself, rather than the underlying physics. For a deeper understanding of the physics involved, I recommend "Introduction to Molecular Dynamics" by Allen and Smit.

## Contents

- **Tutorial 1: System Equilibration and Production**
  - Learn how to equilibrate your system and produce reliable simulation results.
  
- **Tutorial 2: Basic Post-Processing**
  - Analyze your simulation data with tools like Radial Distribution Function (RDF), Mean Squared Displacement (MSD), Velocity Autocorrelation Function (VACF), and calculate diffusion coefficients.
  
- **Tutorial 3: Writing Your Own MD Simulator (TBD)**
  - Get a sneak peek into developing your own MD simulator, featuring code excerpts from my Neural LE repository.
